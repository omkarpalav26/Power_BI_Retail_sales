At the heart of this project lies the Executive Dashboardâ€”a comprehensive hub showcasing vital business metrics. From total revenue and profit to order volumes and weekly trends, this dashboard offers a holistic view of the company's performance at a glance. It's a powerful tool that empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions and steer the company towards success.

The Map View Dashboard takes us on a geographical exploration, uncovering regional trends and opportunities. By visualizing sales data on an interactive map, we're able to pinpoint areas of growth and optimize distribution channels.

Delving deeper into the product realm, the Product View Dashboard zooms in on individual product performance. Here, we analyze key metrics specific to each product, from sales volumes to customer feedback. By understanding the performance of each product, we're able to refine our product strategy, identify top-performing products, and capitalize on emerging trends in the market.

Last but not least, the Customer View Dashboard puts the spotlight on our valued customers. Through advanced analytics, we gain valuable insights into customer behavior, preferences, and satisfaction levels, empowering us to deliver personalized experiences and build lasting relationships.

This project has been an exhilarating journey of data exploration and visualization. From crafting intuitive dashboards to uncovering actionable insights, every step has been driven by a passion for leveraging data to make a tangible impact.
